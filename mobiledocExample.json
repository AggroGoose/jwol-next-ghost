Mobiledoc objects can only be retrieved through the AdminAPI and not through ContentAPI, but they remove all predefined ghost css and remove the need for third party html parsers to convert the rich text into react modules. Using the mobiledoc object provides greater flexibility for customization and development while using Ghost as a backend.",

  "devcomment2": "Mobiledoc splits into four key sections: atoms, cards, markup and sections. The sections field is an array of 'array objects' that determine where everything goes and has markers to indicate whether it's a text or list field or whether it's a predefined card object. (i.e. embeds, callouts, raw html, or other predefined objects). The text objects in the sections area then contain arrays of rich text fields with markers to indicate 'markup' styling (bold, italic, etc. but also used to mark a tags and links) as well as to 'atoms' which contain arbitrary data like referencing a database id for a user tagged in a comment or some such.",
