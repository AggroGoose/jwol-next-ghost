        I don't believe we should be defined by the expectations that others
        place on us. We spend a lot of time and energy trying to meet others
        expectations and social rules, and for many of us it only causes
        anxiety. <b>We're not built the same</b>, and that's a good thing!

        You see we're all built differently; Different cultures, backgrounds,
        religions, and even different brain structures. Humans aren't meant to
        be carbon copies of each other. the things that make us different add{" "}

        <b>Josh Without Leave</b> stems from my nickname in school, JWOL, which
        was a play on the acronym AWOL (<i>Absent Without Official Leave</i>). I
        earned the nickname because of my frequent absences from school, which
        stemmed from struggles with mental health. I grew to wear it as a badge
        to say,{" "}
        <i>
          <b>"I am Josh, and I don't need any Official Leave to be me."</b>
