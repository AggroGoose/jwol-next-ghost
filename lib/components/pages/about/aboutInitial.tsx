        I'm a fan of word play, and 'No Leave Society' could be interpreted a
        number of ways:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          It could be a society where we're out of work leave (vacation) and so
          we're instead browsing the interwebz and hanging out on this cool
          website.
        </li>
        <li>
          It could be a society that's pretty cool so people don't want to
          leave.
        </li>
        <li>My intention is that 'No Leave' loosely means 'No Permission'.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Pump the Brakes Real Fast!</h2>
      <p>
        <b>LET ME BE CLEAR: </b>
        <i>
          No permission does <b>not</b> mean we're doing things that impact
          others without <b>CONSENT</b>.
        </i>
      </p>
      <p>
        No leave is the idea that{" "}
        <b>we don't need outside permission to be who we are</b>. The larger
        society might judge you for how you look, think, speak, or act. I
        believe we need to build a new society where the differences between us
        are celebrated. The new, unique, and{" "}
        <b>
          <i>the weird</i>
        </b>{" "}
        parts of us should be what cements our place in the global community.
      </p>

      <i>
        Unless the unique or weird parts involve intentionally causing harm,
        that's a no go. Do as ye will but cause no harm or however the saying
        goes.
      </i>
      <p>
        Ultimately, this site is a place for me to share journals about life,
        mental health, society, travel, and food. Eventually I will also be
        including short stories and other writing blurbs as a creative outlet.
        That said, most of my content (aside from food, maybe) will be centered
        around this theme of breaking down society's views and seeing things in
        a new light.{" "}
      </p>
      <p>
        We're embracing{" "}
        <b>
          <i>the weirdness</i>
        </b>{" "}
        that adds color and{" "}
        <b>
          <i>spice</i>
        </b>{" "}
        to what would otherwise be a very boring world.

      <h1>So Who's This Author Guy?</h1>
      <p>
        I'm a millenial ADHD dude that grew up in a society that didn't
        appreciate people who acted differently, thought differently, or dared
        to ask questions. Considering those three things are my only
        identifiable personality traits, this wasn't very well received by the
        greater society.
      </p>
      <Image
        src="/images/IMG_4480.jpg"
        alt="Image of the author drinking boba through a straw."
        width={1600}
        height={900}
      />
      <p>
        I spent so much and energy trying to be whatever the greater society
        wanted me to be, but I could never get it right. Then one day I decided
        I was tired of failing by metrics and expectations that others placed on
        me. I was going to live by my own metrics, determine my own self worth,
        and embrace my{" "}
        <b>
          <i>inner weird</i>
        </b>
        .
      </p>
      <p>
        I let go of the need to be what I thought everyone wanted, because I
        realized that nobody really cares anyway. There are people who are going
        to have bad things to say about you no matter who you are or what you
        do. Embracing this idea, and surrounding myself with people who actually
        liked my quirkiness and different perspectives, the world shone in a
        completely new life.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>
          <i>
            There is nothing as freeing as letting go of others' expectations.
          </i>
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>
        Now I was free to pursue what I wanted in life. I could pursue 500
        hobbies, because I'm ADHD, and not care about judgement of others. I
        could question my environment or question society freely because my mind
        and thoughts were my own. Heck I could even{" "}
        <b>
          <i>start my own blog</i>
        </b>{" "}
        about my random travels, hobbies, and experiences.
      </p>
      <p>
        If people aren't interested in my opinions, they'll likely pass on by
        and that's fine, but if you're here and have read this far, then
        hopefully something here has sparked something for you, or{" "}
        <b>
          <i>maybe you're also interested in building a new society</i>
        </b>{" "}
        where people feel comfortable and{" "}
        <b>
          <i>safe</i>
        </b>{" "}
        as who they are.
      </p>
      <p>
        Otherwise, I'm just a normal dude living in Rocky Mountain Colorado in
        the U.S.A. This website will be my creative outlet for my philosophies
        and the things I love.
